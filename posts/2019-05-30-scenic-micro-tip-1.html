This is in order to <strong>save one line per level of nesting</strong> when running <code class="inline">mix format</code>, as the capture-style (<code class="inline">&amp;(&amp;1 * &amp;1)</code>) is allowed to keep its start and first expression terms on the same line whereas the arrow-style (<code class="inline">fn x -&gt; x*x end</code>) isn’t. Unfortunately, it is not allowed to nest captures, so they can only be used on the first level.</p><p>For those that prefer consistency or just arrow-style anonymous functions, the following version might be more appealing, although still not that pleasant:</p><pre><code class="language-elixir">@graph Graph.build(font: :roboto, font_size: 16)
